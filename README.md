use MazeRouter.py and test.py

when prompted for input in test.py:

input the positions and layers of the pins in the this order

1- source row
2- source col
3- source layer
4- target row
5- target col
6- target layer

the shortest path will be given for each layer
g and f are used for the A* Algorithm's fuction:
  f = g + h, where h is the heuristic
  
the path is also shown as a 3D graph
